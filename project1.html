    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Used Systems Engineering fundamentals to develop a Raspberry Pi-based control system to automate the irrigation of guayule fields for the $15M+ Sustainable Bioeconomy in Arid Regions (SBAR) research project. Coordinated with university and USDA researchers to define design criteria and created software scripts, an electrical wiring diagram, and a functioning prototype.
    </p>

    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <img src="Screenshot 2024-06-11 094952.png" alt="Current System Configuration Diagram" />

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primary controller:</strong> Raspberry Pi with display & GSM modem</li>
      <li><strong>Peripheral devices:</strong> Flow meters, pressure sensors, solenoids</li>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> RS-232 serial + I²C protocols</li>
      <li><strong>Custom PCBs:</strong> Relay control boards, analog signal converter</li>
      <li><strong>Software:</strong> Python and shell scripts for automation and logging</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wiring Diagram</h2>

    <p>
      This system distributes 120VAC power into three regulated outputs—24VAC, 12VDC, and 5VDC—to support a range of automation and sensing components, with surge and circuit protection at every stage. Incoming 120VAC is routed through a Class III surge protector, with the hot wire protected by a 2A breaker before branching to three power supplies: a 24VAC transformer, a 12VDC supply, and a 5VDC supply. Each supply has its own surge breaker (0.5A, 10A, and 8A respectively) and feeds into dedicated distribution blocks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 5VDC system powers 13 devices, including a Raspberry Pi, GSM shield, Bluetooth transmitter, 5 flow meters, and 5 pressure transducers. The 12VDC system powers the UC32 pulse counter, a 0–10V ADC board, two 8-channel relay boards, and an 8" display monitor via a barrel jack. The 24VAC system operates only the irrigation solenoid valves and is isolated from ground for safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      Relay boards manage power routing and control. Relay Control Board #1 selectively routes valve neutral lines either to ground (for SHIP bypass) or to the internal system. Relay Control Board #2 toggles 24VAC hot lines to the valves, enabling irrigation control when relays on Board #1 permit it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flow meters connect through terminal blocks and feed digital pulses to the UC32, while pressure transducers send analog voltage signals to the ADC. Pull-down resistors tied to the DC Negative Bus ensure clean logic levels and accurate readings.
    </p>

    <p>
      All DC negative and ground wires route to a shared Ground Bus, bonded to the enclosure for safety. If a hot wire contacts the enclosure, a low-resistance short trips a breaker instantly, protecting users and equipment.
